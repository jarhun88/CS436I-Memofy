## Tech used from Course

**Unit 1 - HTML, CSS, JS**
  - HTML fundamentals are used for creating the Memofy client UI into separate components. 
  - CSS is used to stylize various ui components.
  - JS fundamentals are used for implementing both client and server side logic for this application.

**Unit 2 - React & Redux**
  - React is used as the client framework for this application for designing unique, reusable UI components. 
  - Redux is used for storing/retrieving Memofy's client side state logic.

**Unit 3 - MongoDB**
  - MongoDB is used to store persistent data such as users, fridges and items for the Memofy server application. 

**Unit 4 - Node & Express**
  - Node is used as the main server side language for Memofy and connects all our endpoint and DB logic together. 
  - Express is used in this application to create server endpoints that can be called from the Memofy client application.

**Unit 5 - Release Engineering**
  - Heroku is used as Memofy's cloud hosting platform.

## 'Above and Beyond' functionality

**JWT Token authentication**

**Using TypeScript**

**Using modern React and Redux tooling and patterns**

**Using ReduxThunk**

**Using Debouncer for searching**

**Exercising modern backend patterns to format project file structure**

## Next Steps

**Recipes**
  - Allow users to store different recipes on their account so they can easily determine whether or not they have all the necessary ingredients in their fridge.

**Order food (Subscription service)**
  - Implement the ability for users to directly order the groceries they would like through the application.

**Email/Push notifications**
  - Introduce an email service that notifies users when their fridges/items are being modified.
